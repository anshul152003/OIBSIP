      <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, British India. He was the second of four
        children born to Janakinath Bose, a lawyer, and Prabhavati Devi. Bose was educated at Presidency College in
        Calcutta, where he studied philosophy and political science. He graduated with honors in 1919.<br><br>

        In 1920, Bose went to England to study for the Indian Civil Service. He passed the exams but decided not to join
        the service. Instead, he returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress (INC), a political party that
        was fighting for Indian independence from British rule.<br><br>

        Bose quickly rose through the ranks of the INC. He was elected president of the party in 1938 and 1939. As
        president, Bose led the INC in a more radical direction. He called for mass mobilization and civil disobedience
        against British rule.<br><br>

        Bose's leadership style was not popular with all members of the INC. He was accused of being too authoritarian
        and of being too close to the Soviet Union. In 1939, he was expelled from the INC.<br><br>

        Bose then founded the Forward Bloc, a socialist political party that was committed to the overthrow of British
        rule. The Forward Bloc was a small party, but it attracted a large following among young people and workers.<br><br>

        In 1941, Bose escaped from India and traveled to Germany. He met with Nazi leaders and offered to form an Indian
        army to fight against the British. The Nazis agreed to help Bose, and he formed the Indian Legion, a force of
        Indian prisoners of war who had been captured by the Germans.<br><br>

        In 1943, Bose traveled to Japan. He met with Japanese leaders and convinced them to allow him to form the Indian
        National Army (INA). The INA was made up of Indian prisoners of war who had been captured by the Japanese, as
        well as Indians who had volunteered to fight for Indian independence.<br><br>

        The INA fought alongside the Japanese against the British in Southeast Asia. The INA was a symbol of hope for
        many Indians, and it played a significant role in the British defeat in Southeast Asia.<br><br>

        Bose disappeared in 1945. There are many theories about what happened to him. Some believe that he died in a
        plane crash, while others believe that he escaped to the Soviet Union. The mystery of Bose's disappearance has
        never been solved.<br><br>

        Subhas Chandra Bose was a complex and controversial figure. He was a brilliant orator and a charismatic leader.
        He was also a ruthless and authoritarian figure. Bose was a committed nationalist, and he dedicated his life to
        the cause of Indian independence. He was a hero to many Indians, and his legacy continues to inspire people
        today.<br><br>
